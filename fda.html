<details>
        <summary>What is the “FDA Official Site”?</summary>
        <p>The FDA Official Site refers to the primary web portal maintained by the FDA. It provides authoritative information on regulations, guidance documents, enforcement actions, databases, and public-health communications. It is the central resource for regulated industry, healthcare professionals and consumers to access updates and official FDA policy.</p>
      </details>
<details>
        <summary>What are “Warning Letters”?</summary>
        <p>Warning Letters are formal notices the FDA issues to a company or individual when inspections or reviews reveal significant violations of federal laws or regulations. These letters identify the concern(s) and request a corrective-action response within a specified timeframe.</p>
      </details>
<details>
        <summary>What are “Guidelines”?</summary>
        <p>Guidelines are documents issued by the FDA that describe the agency’s current thinking on regulatory or compliance matters (such as Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), clinical trials, labeling etc.). Although not legally binding in the same way as statutes or regulations, they provide detailed advice to industry and help interpret how FDA expects regulated parties to operate.</p>
      </details>
<details>
        <summary>What are “Drug Databases”?</summary>
        <p>Drug databases refer to searchable electronic collections maintained or referenced by the FDA that include information on approved drugs, biologics, adverse-event data, safety labels, and other post-market surveillance records. These support transparency and enable stakeholders to find regulatory, safety or compliance information.</p>
      </details>
<details>
        <summary>What are “Clinical Trials”?</summary>
        <p>Clinical trials are research studies involving human participants, designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drugs, biologics, or medical devices. The FDA regulates the design, conduct, monitoring, and reporting of clinical trials to ensure the rights, safety and data integrity of participants and to support regulatory decision-making.</p>
      </details>
<details>
        <summary>What are “Medical Devices”?</summary>
        <p>Medical devices are instruments, apparatus, implants, software, or related articles intended for use in the diagnosis, prevention, monitoring or treatment of disease or injury in humans. The FDA oversees their regulation throughout development, manufacturing, labeling, distribution and post-market surveillance to protect public health.</p>
      </details>
<details>
        <summary>What is “ECFR (21 CFR)”?</summary>
        <p>“ECFR (21 CFR)” refers to the Electronic Code of Federal Regulations containing Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Title 21 includes rules issued by the FDA governing food, drugs, biologics, devices and other regulated products. Industry uses 21 CFR to locate legally binding regulatory requirements.</p>
      </details>
<details>
        <summary>What is “Form 483”?</summary>
        <p>Form 483 (officially “Inspectional Observations”) is a form issued at the end of an FDA inspection when investigators observe conditions or practices that may violate regulatory requirements.

      </details>
<details>
        <summary>What is the “Inspection Dashboard”?</summary>
        <p>The Inspection Dashboard is a data-visualization tool on the FDA’s public portal (for example via the FDA Data Dashboard) that displays inspection statistics: number of inspections by fiscal year, by product category, domestic versus foreign, regulatory outcomes, etc. It enhances transparency into the FDA’s inspections and compliance activities.</p>
      </details>

It supports post-market surveillance and timely safety communications.</p>
      </details>
